## Chalk

[HAGOROMO Fulltouch Luminous Chalk, $20](https://www.amazon.com/HAGOROMO-Fulltouch-Luminous-Chalk-Color/dp/B072LT8P92/ref=sxin_2_ac_d_pm?ac_md=2-1-QmV0d2VlbiAkMjAgYW5kICQyNQ%3D%3D-ac_d_pm&keywords=hagoromo&pd_rd_i=B072LT8P92&pd_rd_r=bb515b41-e860-4602-ad4e-3feaa55598d9&pd_rd_w=SdQsM&pd_rd_wg=JFz3m&pf_rd_p=aed08533-d0f3-456a-bfcd-3ec60fc417c9&pf_rd_r=E278Z524Q5QEZ8F04BX3&psc=1&qid=1567961232&s=gateway).

This chalk is just... luminous.  Try it for yourself.

(TODO: add a discussion on old vs. new).

## Pens

[Lamy Safari, $29.60](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-shiny-black)

The classic introductory fountain pen.  The charcoal version is satisfyingly matte. Extra-fine weight lets you pack tons of math into a single page.

[TWSBI Diamond 580, $50.00](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/demonstrator-pens/products/twsbi-diamond-580-fountain-pen-clear?variant=11884892028971)

A step up from the Safari, and a worthwhile investment if you switch to exclusively fountain pens.  The transparent casing lets you watch the liquid flow (which is especially fun if you study fluid dynamics).  The ink chamber is a lot larger than the Safari's, so you can continuously write for about a week before the refill.

## Ink

[Iroshizuku, tsuki-yo, $18](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Iroshizuku-Fountain-Moonlight-69205/dp/B003MVIYZM/ref=sxin_3_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-aXJvc2hpenVrdSBpbms%3D-ac_d_rm&crid=2CI08OORSX5R&keywords=iroshizuku+ink&pd_rd_i=B003MVIYZM&pd_rd_r=3d17c0a2-6e49-4fec-9699-2b009697f669&pd_rd_w=drFER&pd_rd_wg=iMag2&pf_rd_p=404c4843-2c96-4d0d-a5fe-2b0598693e61&pf_rd_r=7F62ZMMK7NP540CG57S9&qid=1567961531&s=gateway&sprefix=irosh%2Caps%2C215)

The best teal ink that synergizes with the Safari or TWSBI.  Available in smaller bottles if you want to sample more inks, but this particular bottle has really nice aesthetics.

## Paper

[Leuchturm1917, $19.95](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002TSIMW4/ref=twister_B07SKL6TFX?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).

The classic German notebook ("Leuchturm" translates to "lighthouse").  The dotted variety lets you think about math unrestrained by the tyranny of the ruled page.
